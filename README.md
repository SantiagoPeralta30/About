# Hello! My name is Santiago Peralta.

## Who am I?
I am a Fullstack programmer focused on Back-End design and troubleshooting in code.

Since my adolescence, I have been fascinated with the world of programming, but for various reasons, I could not pursue this passion. Recently, I was able to start delving into Javascript thanks to the soyHenry bootcamp.

## What do I do?
Currently, I dedicate myself to carrying out small personal projects to hone my programming skills. It fills me with happiness when I can find the solution to a problem that arose in some code.

## Where am I headed?
My current goal is to live my dream of being a programmer and being able to make an impact in this wonderful world.

I am not entering the programming market just because of the current demand in the world. As I said, for years, I have been fascinated by the functioning of different computer programs and electronic devices with user interfaces. The main focus of my goal is to innovate in solutions to problems that were already believed to be solved and to broaden my horizons with each step I take within this wonderful career.

## What technologies do I use?
The soyHenry bootcamp provided me with the necessary knowledge and experience to make my launch into the world of development. The technologies I handle are:

-**Javascript**
-**Node.js**
-**Express.js**
-**Sequelize**
-**PostgresSQL**
-**React.js**
-**Redux**
-**HTML**
-**Pure CSS**
-**GIT**
